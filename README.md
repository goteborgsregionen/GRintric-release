## Local development - *adding GR-fork additions in italics*

Read below on how to setup the project for local development.

### Requirements

* Python >=3.10
* Docker

#### Additional requirements

Additionally, in order to be able to use the platform to the fullest, install `libmagic` and `ffmpeg`.

```
sudo apt-get install libmagic1
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Setup steps: Backend

To run the backend for this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install poetry. This can be done by following the instructions on https://python-poetry.org/docs/.
2. Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal.

*In backend/pyproject.toml:*

*rad 8: python = "^3.12"*

*rad 20: asyncpg = "^0.29.0"*

*rad 42: dependency-injector = "^4.42.0"*

*`poetry lock --no-update`*

3. Run `poetry install` to install all dependencies into the current environment.
4. Copy .env.template to a .env, and fill in the required values. The required values can be found in `backend/README.md`.

*added default values to template*

5. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the required dependencies.
6. Run `poetry run python init_db.py` to run the migrations and setup the environment.
7. Run `poetry run start` to start the project for development.
8. (Optional) Run `poetry run arq src.instorage.worker.worker.WorkerSettings` to start the worker.

*Test*

*curl http://localhost:8123/api/v1/users/*

*Should receive:*

*{"message":"Unauthenticated""intric_error_code":9005}*

### Setup steps: Frontend

To run the frontend for this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Install node >= v20 (https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Install pnpm 8.9.0 (https://pnpm.io/)
3. Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal

*`sudo apt install -y nodejs npm`*
*`sudo npm install -g pnpm@8.9.0`*
*`chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`*

4. Run `pnpm run setup`
5. Navigate to `frontend/apps/web` and setup the .env file using the .env.example. You can learn more about the environment variables in `frontend/apps/web/README.md`

6. Run `pnpm -w run dev` to start the project for development.
7. Navigate to `localhost:3000` and login with email `user@example.com` and password `Password1!` (provided you have run the setup steps for the backend).
